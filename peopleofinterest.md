# People Of Interest

### Ada Lovelace
Over a century before computers were invented, Ada envistioned a machine that could manipulate symbols, instead of just numbers. That idea is what gives her, in the eyes of some, the title of the world's first programmer. She met Charles Babbage, "The father of the computer" in 1833, and the two continued to be in contact for over 2 decades. Even while being a wife, mother, and noblewoman, Ada found time to continue her work.  

### Charles Babbage
Charles invented the first computer in 1837. He called it the analytical engine, with the intention of using it for math problems, to replace the existing "computers," mathmaticains who solved problems with the aid of textbooks and tables. The analytical engine was never built, however that doesn't change it's importance. 

### Joseph Marie Charles
Joseph was what truly influenced Babbage's design for the analytical engine. Joseph was a weaver and merchant, but he also invented the Jacquard loom in 1801. The loom greatly influenced binary logic, which had a huge affect on the development of computers.
