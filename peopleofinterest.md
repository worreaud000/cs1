# People Of Interest

### Ada Lovelace
Over a century before computers were invented, Ada envistioned a machine that could manipulate symbols, instead of just numbers. That idea is what gives her, in the eyes of some, the title of the world's first programmer. She met Charles Babbage, "The father of the computer" in 1833, and the two continued to be in contact for over 2 decades. Even while being a wife, mother, and noblewoman, Ada found time to continue her work.  

### Charles Babbage
Charles invented the first computer in 1837. He called it the analytical engine, with the intention of using it for math problems, to replace the existing "computers," mathmaticains who solved problems with the aid of textbooks and tables. The analytical engine was never built, however that doesn't change it's importance. 

### Joseph Marie Charles
Joseph was what truly influenced Babbage's design for the analytical engine. Joseph was a weaver and merchant, but he also invented the Jacquard loom in 1801. The loom greatly influenced binary logic, which had a huge affect on the development of computers. 

### Herman Hollerith
Herman was a German immigrant. He invented a punch-card system that became the future of data counting. The US had to do censuses every 2 years, however there were too many people and too much data, that it took nearly 9 years to count data that had to be counted every 2. With the punched cards, counting this data became far more efficient and possible, and narrowed the time required down to around 3 months. This invention was yet another influence of the modern day binary logic system.

### John Backus
Backus was a part of the team who invented the first widely used high-level programming language. He graduated from Columbia University with a master's defree in math in 1949, and lived from 1924 to 2007. He was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Delaware. 

### Margaret Hamilton
Margaret is the person who made the term "software engineering" something to be taken seriously. She also helped pave the way for women in STEM fields. She was born in 1936. She is the Director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumenation Laboratory. 

### Gottfried Wilhelm
Gottfried was born in 1646, and lived until 1716. He holds a big part of the history of math, philosophy, and computer science.

### Polybius
Polybius was an ancient greek historian of the Hellenistic period. He came up with a tool for telegraphy called the "Polybius square". The letters of it are arranged left to right, top to bottom in a 5 by 5 square.

### Mary, Queen of Scots
Mary used encryption in the 1500s to help assassinate Queen Elizabeth I and take the throne for herself.
